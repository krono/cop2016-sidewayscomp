\begin{abstract}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Sideways composition is a valuable means of abstraction.
  \item COP notably applies SC for good modularity.
  \item Most COP implementations have a substantial performance overhead.
  \item This is because weaving and execution of layered methods violate common
    assumptions about lookup.
  \item Meta-tracing JITs have unique characteristics that can alleviate the
    performance overhead.
  \item They don't need to make as strong assumptions as traditional execution
    environments have to.
  \item We postulate that MT-JITs are good at optimizing sideways composition
    and give initial results.
  \item We show that hints for the JIT compiler in the COP implementation can
    improve performance further.
  \end{itemize}
