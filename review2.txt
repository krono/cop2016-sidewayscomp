----------- Review -----------
Not being very knowledgeable in JIT / meta-tracing techniques, I have very little to say about this paper, apart from the fact that it was very clear, well written and organized, and quite easy to follow. The only grief that I have is that I would have liked more details in sections 3.2 and 4, which look like the heart of the work.
